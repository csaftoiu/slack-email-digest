  <b>andrew</b>: It does sound like a plan! :appreciation: </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: Meanwhile, after 3 hours of walking through bush land, I could not shake being anxious and fearful....</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: I had a couple of pretty decent insights into the fear, (money, possessions, and reputation), my issue here is the following:</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: How do I stop scratching the surface with this stuff? I'll give the first insight as an example.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: So, I parked my ute in a secluded area (there wasn't an option), which I never like doing as I have probably $7000 worth of tools locked in the back. So, I knew the anxiety was about this. I couldn't shake it, put it to one side, even though I was really trying to get that "this is my only moment of being alive" step up and running. Thinking more about it, as I walked deeper into the bush, I thought through the facts. I have "tradies" insurance for all the tools, so factually, I would have no more than an inconvenience to deal with if they were stolen. </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: This didn't change the feeling. I noticed then that I am attached to my tools, I really see them as an extension of me, which leads obviously to regarding them as 'my' tools, I.e. an identity thing, possessiveness, property rights etc. </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: I could see a little while later than they cannot actually be stolen ultimately, as to put it crudely, the universe cannot steal from itself.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: Being well out of sight of any man made features, roads, football field, etc with only the sounds of traffic from adjoining roads, the anxiety did ease a little bit.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: I enjoyed watching some bees collecting nectar, enjoyed finding a rabbit warren, enjoyed finding a surprisingly neat bonfire pit (there was no rubbish, which I'd never seen before), and had a moment without my glasses on, (I'm slightly short sighted), looking at a grass tree , which was quite amazing as I couldn't focus on it, and it was like a green explosion of lines waving in the breeze. Encouraging, but still no naivete. </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: The next layer of anxiety was the fact I'm flat broke right now. Worse than broke actually, but I won't go into that. But between that and some consideration for how my business reputation will be damaged if I can't pay the electrician and plumber soon, I started getting confused about how to separate fact from fiction, and how to mentally phrase what I was seeing. I know, factually, that none of the mess is actually my fault, as I didn't invent any of the system I live by, or make the human condition up either. But facts are, these worries, just won't budge enough, even temporarily, to get this going. </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: Not that I'm giving up, first decent attempt in the day in the right setting, and I'm pleased to have atleast come back with a question about how others separate fact from fiction. (For the record, I am doing everything I can to fix my financial situation).</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: Ah, no need to reply! I need to contemplate it further. I haven't given myself enough time for the confusion to ease...doh!</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: Sounds pretty good Andrew ! The tensions easing up when going away from inhabitation works for me too and I wonder if its the constant barrage of sounds in inhabited places that keeps a baseline fear or it is the awareness of being around humans aka the social identity on guard which keeps such a fear in inhabited places..I guess I can do a simple test n see - plug my ears with something to cancel out all sounds n see the fear levels </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>jamesjj</b>: I had pce's early on but have not had one in a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I did have an incident around Oct 2015 in which time seemingly stopped. This was brief but did not seem like pce's I had in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't recognize what it was at the time.<br><br>I wasn't using thc in those days and had a real clear mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a real restful afternoon nap and awoke feeling great.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got up there were birds chirping loudly and I heard the breeze blowing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was standing still like I was frozen and nothing seemed to be moving.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no thought that I recall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Time had stopped.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: Fact : One needs money to survive. Belief : Worrying is essential or else I won't be able to make money.<br><br>Its a difficult one to tackle, but I recall how better the brain operates when feeling good.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: Btw, as a different line of approach, how about contemplating something about actuality..stuff such as organic purity, brilliance, perfection etc</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>geoffrey</b>: <span class="at-ref">@actualshashank</span>: yes that belief is not a good one to have. I don't have it but my ex wife has it big time, and it kinda ruined her life.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: Yes, I actually left the bush land after an hour, and went to a more conventional park to both ease the fear, and to get in greener surroundings. I wrote the above story in a shopping center carpark, when I went into the shops, I was surprised how comfortable I was there. I may try in a shopping center next time!</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: Hah yeah I recall asking SKD on how to induce a PCE in a crowded place n she suggested thinking of yourself as Jason Bourne..never gave it a shot hehe</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: Haha, the Bourne Identity!</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: Roflol, thats exactly the reason..I thought I might pick another fabricated identity</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: I've always liked walking through the city at night when there are not many people. I will keep it in mind for an attempt.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: Thats nice..anything that works</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: I've got a really early start tomorrow, so I'm off to bed. Good night!:afhibiscus: </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: Gnite !</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: Reminder to self and others <a href="https://actualfreedom.slack.com/archives/general/p1469815931001145">https://actualfreedom.slack.com/archives/general/p1469815931001145</a></b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: One thing I wanted to note is that in my discussion with Andrew on this topic, I was describing how to bring about a PCE, and explained that I have used two ways to do so, the mappings above are the basic four stages that I went through with each of the two ways I used to bring about PCEs with and mentioned that they roughly map to eachother. <br><br>Chronologically in the early 2000's I started out using the four stages of feeling neutral, feeling good, feeling excellent, feeling perfect before later coming to believe that these stages were intended as a more permanent series of stages of progression on the way to living an ongoing virtual freedom. Regardless of how such stages were or were not intended, they worked for me to bring about a PCE by intentionally moving through them in a similar way as one might move through jhanas or nanas in a pragmatic dharma practice.. just making sure I was experiencing one fully before moving on to the next. It's also worth flagging that at the time I was using these stages I had the understanding that the actualism method was to ask each moment again "how am I experiencing this moment of being alive?" and while we now know that the focus should be on enjoying and appreciating each moment of being alive, I wonder if we have thrown out the baby with the bathwater by largely ceasing to refer to asking HAIETMOBA. <br><br>Later on circa 2009 I started using another set of stages / qualities that were not quite as literal a set of progressions but still something I would work through sequentially FWIW. Yet if I was blocked with one I would go back through the others to see what could help. Namely current time awareness that this is the only moment of being alive, sincerity/naivete, sensuousness, and wide eyed wonder.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also mentioned that identities really have a problem with wide eyed wonder, and it's probably why it's such a challenge to get into apperception. For an identity it can seem ridiculous and embarrassing to go about in a state of wide eyed wonder and obviously one must overcome such resistance to proceed into wonder - here is where making sure one is feeling as naive/innocent as possible could help to overcome such resistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or if I was trying to be sensuous but I was having trouble I might realise I was also still thinking/feeling some issue and the solution would be to ceasing doing so and remember this is my only moment of being alive at this place in space. <br><br>So in the quoted passage I wanted to clarify it's not that literally current time/space awareness = feeling good and etc through the other mappings, but more that they occur around the same time and/or have some relationship to one another in the progression from normal awareness to apperception. E.g. when one is not feeling good generally there is not a predominance of current time/space awareness but instead indulgence in the imagination of other times/places whether past, future or hypothetical crises to be solved. By ceasing to spend this moment - one's only moment of being alive - in such affective imagination, and instead engaging ones current time/space awareness then one can immediately start feeling good .. a block has been removed. <br><br>Also if sensuousness was to be mapped to any other quality of the actualism lingo I would map it to enjoyment .. one is fully enjoying and appreciating this moment of being alive when one is fully sensuous. <br><br>When one is allowing wide eyed wonder, and I say allowing because to get into apperception "I" don't do it - I simply allow it to occur, it's almost guaranteed apperception will occur by this point if one isn't interrupted. Similarly when one is feeling perfect, that doesn't really allow for any imperfection does it? So again assuming one doesn't answer an important phone call or bump into someone or whatever, continuing to proceed one is practically assured of experiencing apperception by the time we get to feeling perfect. One is literally on the cusp of pure consciousness.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: It's so funny to remember all of this and out of habit, try to do it to be sure I know what I'm talking about; just now I tried to feel perfect .... and of course nothing happened. Perfect stillness continued unabated. But I cannot feel perfect, because as great as that it - it is still a feeling. Now everything just IS perfect .. it will never <b>feel</b> one way or the other again.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: Well it's the middle of the night - I'm going back to bed :slightly_smiling_face:</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>claudiu.s</b>: some mighty good advice there!</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>claudiu.s</b>: sure enough now that my attention has been brought to it, i was in a state of wide eyed wonder before my 1st pce</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: Yea that's good "map" to keep in mind. Tells me what to do at any point of stuckness </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>felipetheparasite</b>: during a walk, i also see the progress by noticing how any thought or sensory stimuli that commonly causes trouble sticks or doesn't stick with me. as i progress from neutral toward perfection, there are different degrees. when feeling good, they stick around but i accept them, have fun feeling them and then they go away when attention shifts. in excellence, they are just fleeting moments and seeing how i become impermeable to them is actually another source of wonder that adds to the feedback (like "wow, look how easily these "problems" go away, how the hell they created such a mess before?). in perfection, those thoughts rarely arise, it's just a different ball game.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>felipetheparasite</b>: of course that's not the description of every walk in the park. just the best or ideal ones. :slightly_smiling_face:</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>hunterad93</b>: I have thinking about your phrase "fuck you" money <span class="at-ref">@felipetheparasite</span> and about autonomy more generally. I think in the past, pursuing autonomy never worked for me since I had my intentions pointing the wrong way with it, I wanted to be untouchable more than have a good time. I think if instead I use autonomy as a tool to reject arguing but then redirect towards a more harmonious and intimate vibe it might be more worth pursuing. <br><br>For example, if there is an argument, I can simply not care about winning it via recognizing that I am autonomous (financially and emotionally) and don't need to bother with it. Then I can either redirect the interaction towards harmonious enjoyment or I could (what I used to do) avoid continued interaction. Going to have to try the former out in real life for a few days, it makes autonomy a lot more helpful. Autonomy gives power over oneself in an interaction, but it can still be used for benign or aggressive intentions from that point.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: Thanks for the advice <span class="at-ref">@craig</span> ! Could you also tell how much did accessing/tapping into Pure Intent feature in your move towards actual freedom ? Were you able to access it from the place of a feeling being ? </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>claudiu.s</b>: <span class="at-ref">@actualshashank</span>: ah I asked him this recently, he directed me to #22054 and #22094</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: aah thanks !</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: When worry (about some other time) is not an active occurrence I find that fantasy (about some other place) takes over. </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: That needs to go as well for current time awareness to function</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>geoffrey</b>: I smoke some cannabis yesterday evening for the first time in months. The old emotional habits came back in full force. All connection to pure intent was lost, not just in the "high" (which I did not remember to be so full of "soul"), but hours later. Until now in fact (late afternoon the day after). I had been a regular smoker for years, and if I believe it somehow trained me to pay attention to feelings, it mostly trained me to repress (the bad trip being a possibility, you have to dissociate and cultivate good feelings). I can see how a light dosage, for "normal" people, could help them getting out of their normal identity and maybe access some purity, but once you have been a regular smoker, I believe the identity used to it feasts on it. Anyway that's my impression. Btw I would be curious about the effect of cannabis on an actually free body. Has it been tested?</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: Occasional helped me pay attention to feelings "in real time" but it didn't do anything to actualize any insights from it. "I" still have to do it</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: Hmm not sure of canabis, but Richard has spoken about effects of alcohol, coffee and adrenalin and they are not nice for him.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: <span class="at-ref">@craig</span>: A doubt arose while attempting to contemplate the feeling of separartion..I could see that the feeling of separation indeed occurs due to the feeling of a separate identity..but since there is an actual separation between discreet flesh n blood bodies, then isn't separation actual ? Or is it the case that separation is not actual because we are all made of the same physical matter ?</b>

</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: <span class="at-ref">@srid</span> It's great you noticed that. I stuck with "current time awareness" as its a phrase Richard uses. Similarly HAIETMOBA drops "at this place in space" for brevity. "current time/space awareness" would be more specific, or perhaps "immediate temporal-spatial attentiveness". <br><br>It is easy to recognise that factually I am always right here and it is always just now. Living in accord with this fact requires a habit to be developed as a feeling being;&nbsp;&nbsp;HAIETMOBA assists one to imitate the actual. Its well worth the effort. </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: Cool. I like scientific-sounding terms like &#8220;immediate temporal-spatial attentiveness&#8221; (ITSA), though &#8220;current time/space awareness&#8221; works well. :slightly_smiling_face: I see that asking HAIETMOBA (which looks simplistic to the untrained eye) automatically brings me to &#8216;current time/space awareness&#8217; first, as that&#8217;s a requisitive. and then i&#8217;m left with attending to whatever fantasy/worry that took me off it in the first place.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: also: being on a fantasy is almost like being on a 'parallel universe&#8217; (which is interesting if one is into sci-fi), and one learns to recognize it and comes back to the 'current universe' (current space awareness).</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: likewise: worrying is almost like time-travel; one recognizes it and comes back to &#8216;now&#8217; (current time awareness)</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: (and it is the identity, not the body, that does universe-travelling and time-travelling)</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: <span class="at-ref">@actualshashank</span>: you may be looking for an intellectual answer but the solution is experiential. Experientially there is a normally always a feeling of separation between this body and that body and every body. In apperception there is no such feeling of separation. The feeling of separation prevents the experience of intimacy.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: Is it accurate to call it &#8216;body-to-body intimacy&#8217;? (with only air/space in between)?</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: It can be intimacy with anything.... with other flesh and blood bodies,&nbsp;&nbsp;but also with inanimate objects</b>

</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: I finally saw how lust morphs into frustration. When a woman "outside of my league" comes into vision sometimes the lustful energy "morphs" into the energy of frustration (of not being part of that league). Once I saw the morphing, it stopped progressing and it took a minute before the physical symptoms subsided</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: Curiously (at least in my case) this generally does not happen with "hot women" but rather with women that are known to be "fashionable" (moderate hotness but high fashion)</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: Fashion creates leagues; and makes men work to climb them. Ha, a hidden hierarchy :)</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>geoffrey</b>: Going further on the &#171;&#160;cannabis question&#160;&#171;&#160; : 1. Has a &#171;&#160;poll&#160;&#187; ever been done amongst actually free people about how they react to substances (coffee, alcohol, nicotine, etc.), so that it can be known what depends on this or that person and what depends on the actually free state itself?</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>geoffrey</b>: 2. Should we deduce from the fact that a substance does not agree with actually free people, that it is not good for someone trying to become free?</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: I don't know if anyone knows about the other actually free people than Richard. Richard has written about his own sensitivities. </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: I have mostly ceased consuming alcohol as it now only serves to make me tired. The former effect of taking the edge off is no longer needed.<br><br>I have also reduced my caffeine intake to one normal coffee a day and after that consume decaf coffees, as i dont like the physical effects of 5-6 strong coffees a day</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: I have never smoked so i cant tell you anything about nicotine</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>geoffrey</b>: Thanks! Your report seems consistent with Richard&#8217;s. What then to think about my question 2. ? It appears (moderate) consumption of alcohol and coffee does not prevent one from achieving freedom&#8230; ( I&#8217;d be quite mad to learn in a few years that it was something as stupid as too much coffee for example that impeded me lol)</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: Haha i seem to recall drinking my usual 2-3 glasses of white wine and 5-6 cups of coffee all the way up to when i self immolated so i dont see them in moderation as any particular impediment. </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>geoffrey</b>: That&#8217;s a relief. I do love coffee haha. And nicotine. Coffee and Nicotine! Ain&#8217;t that grand?</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>claudiu.s</b>: A wide and wondrous path indeed :slightly_smiling_face:</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>claudiu.s</b>: I experimented with cutting out coffee recently .. I decided I enjoy having a daily morning espresso better than no coffee at all </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>johnb</b>: Bulletproof coffee FTW!</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>geoffrey</b>: Can one be free and paleo? Now that is a question</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>geoffrey</b>: damn I was serious at first and now it&#8217;s going DOWN</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>geoffrey</b>: Ok I took a deep breath and I&#8217;m back. I understand that there are now a few actually free people, and I find it somehow disappointing that data is not being (to my knowledge) collected as to (generally) how being actually free affects people, what in Richard&#8217;s very mundane account of his life is proper to him and what is to be attributed to actual freedom.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>claudiu.s</b>: Ahh interesting - which accounts of his do you find mundane ("lacking interest or excitement; dull")? I don't find them mundane at all </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>geoffrey</b>: Damn. Sorry. French. Not what I meant. I meant about the &#171;&#160;mundane&#160;&#187; details of his life. Watching tv, this kind of things.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>geoffrey</b>: I recall him writing about how he couldn&#8217;t wait for other people to become free so that it could be established what were his &#171;&#160;idiosyncrasies&#160;&#187; and what was &#171;&#160;being free&#160;&#187;.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>claudiu.s</b>: Oh yes. I think it's mostly down to a lack of data points </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>claudiu.s</b>: It has already turned out his sensitivity to caffeine was idiosyncratic to him - since it only affected him for a brief period (he can drink coffee now just fine)</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: I guess the thing is, would some mundane element such as continuing to watch tv or preferring to give up overconsumption of caffeine be the deciding factor in whether you want to bring about the end of all the suffering in the world? If not ... then isnt interest in such data merely a distraction by the identity who wants to be relevant in the proceedings that will end in its never being relevant again? At least thats how it was for my former identity who wanted to know this and that.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>mailclark</b>: [redacted]</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>geoffrey</b>: <span class="at-ref">@craig</span>: You&#8217;re right on point.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: It would almost be better if there was no such data... after all the more data there is, the more we can be distracted from self immolation. Richard had none of it to distract him... just the memory of the PCE to go on,&nbsp;&nbsp;and the certainty that life didnt have to be like it was normally.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>adam</b>: <span class="at-ref">@craig</span>: Do you think maintaining a 360 degree awareness is beneficial in habitualizing current/time awareness.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be an easy route to do so.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: What i would like to see more public info on is how the other actually free people self immolated in detail. I find it a bit odd that at least that info wasnt shared semi-anonymously but then I was always approaching it from the online info and the people Richard knew in person weren't.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: <span class="at-ref">@adam</span> I didnt manage to but that doesnt mean it cant... its likely to mean staying close to apperception if you can manage it, so that would theoretically be good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>adam</b>: Yes, I just always have this "big" feeling identity in the way that then keeps getting distracted and expressed via mental conceptualizations of what "I" deem important.&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think is the best way to stop worrying about being financially secure?</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>adam</b>: I can't seem to habitually get rid of that that feeling identity</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>adam</b>: with mental conceptions, I can just stop producing those thoughts, but with a feeling presence, it is not easy to do, again because other "important" things and worries keep getting in the way.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>felipetheparasite</b>: <span class="at-ref">@adam</span>: i feel the same way about finances. what shocked me once was, during one of those voice chats, after i told them i wanted to retire at 40, alan told me "so what's the problem? you are working towards that goal, don't you? so you probably want to retire right now and that's the problem". it was great because it made me acknowledge the fact that i was affectively reaching for something different (i want to stop working now!) vs. the actual (and realistic) goal of retiring after 7-10 years of working. the "getting things done" method could help us here. it says that you should empty your head of all the to-do's and ideas, put them on a list, and actually work through one by one. that way the mind stops giving bandwidth to those thoughts. it seems pretty down to earth. occupation (actually doing things) doesn't need preoccupation (worrying about things).</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: I suggest tackling the worries one at a time by investigating the beliefs that give rise to the feelings</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: An overall understanding that worry about things that aren't happening now prevents us from being happy now helps</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: For example worrying about our financial situation does not change our financial situation. only doing something that generates income or changes our rate of expenditure changes our financial situation</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: In other words action produces results but worry does not</b>
</div>

  <b>ianclarkson</b>: Well, I think so. It seems straight forward, however in practise I can know something is silly and still keep doing it, until I experience it as being silly - this usually happens not as a result of an investigation, but from just being in the right frame of mind to catch it. I don't think I've ever truly done a focussed step by step investigation that resulted in experiencing something as silly. I think I can be in denial about facts quite easily. I'm curious because I haven't come across any other people describing a successful investigation as opposed to simply having a flash of insight due to the intent. I feel like it would be helpful to me to see how other people do it, in order to see if there are easier or more effective ways. My own investigation goes something like this: A particular feeling (stress at work) arises, and I think about it in relation to actuality , I try to define it and to pose ideas on what beliefs would cause the feeling. I then see how there can be many different angles to one feeling but try to trace them back to a particular group, like the need to belong. I look at how it is silly, for example being stressed is silly because I am not enjoying being alive; because the stress makes me less efficient and more prone to making mistakes; because there is no need for it in actuality; because it potentially makes me more difficult to be around, and how I have had it before and nothing beneficial comes of it, and in a few minutes or hours it will be replaced with another feeling or mood. This can add to the confirmation that it is unnecessary. I pretend I am a cave man and wonder what would this feeling be for back then, and then trace forward to now and sometimes see it's irrelevance to this moment and to the happiness and harmlessness of me and the people I am around. I find that then there is a processing stage where my mind will be working on the issue, even as I go through the same event next week. Each time it happens I am more prepared with familiarity and acclimitization (getting more friendly with or used to me feeling that way so as to not squish it or reject it or avoid it)&nbsp;&nbsp;and can see a little bit more, and am a little bit less caught up or overwhelmed. This leads to more confidence and confirmation that it can be discarded. Sometimes it just feels clumsy and uncertain the way I go about it, although I have had results. Other times I can just be lying in bed and drifting and an insight about a feeling or belief will just pop up. I attribute this to the mind making diffuse connections. .....Any thoughts? What is your understanding of silly/sensible?</b>

<div>
  <b>craig</b>: You said "I try to define it and pose ideas on what beliefs would cause the feeling" this may be preventing you from getting to the root of the problem. I often found issues caused by multiple beliefs and each must be dealt with but the best way to identify the belief is to fully feel and <b>go into</b> the feeling to see what belief is attached to it. It should simply become clear as you allow yourself to fully feel it instead of fighting it.</b>

<div>
  <b>ianclarkson</b>: Thanks. I will have to contemplate this.</b>

  <b>andrew</b>: I'm trying (very trying, as my mother would say), to understand the Attentiveness, Sensuousness, and Apperceptiveness article. I get frustrated doing that. Gone as far as numbering each line, and making notes. One of the issues I'm having, is the part about apperception occurring in the chain of senses, and the HAIETMOBA method prolonging this fleeting moment. Is this accurate? Or more importantly, did you find it useful?</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: I remember Nick H essentially advising me along the lines of paying attention to the "sense door" then watch the attention wave buzz it's way through the body, then go back to the sense door. I also remember Richard shutting him down with this, so I stopped. However, this article seems to be saying something very similar. That a constant sensuousness, in conjunction with attention paid to the 'inner world' is the basic method. The obvious difference being the investigating of the material of the inner world, at some point.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: I got so much out of that article but maybe it was my pre-existing success with PCEs... just reading&nbsp;&nbsp;the article would lead to a PCE most times.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: Haha i thought you meant Nick Hosein for a sec there ... aka Fred</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: Haha, Fred. </b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: I never really got the sense door or attention wave concepts ... maybe they are an issue</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: Hmm, OK that's informative. So, it was more the "vibe" of the article, rather than the exact advice in it.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: Cheers</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: So, what I need to do, is stand back from the article more, and get a feel for the overall thing, than get bogged down in the details.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: Worth a shot for sure. Some of the specifics are definitely confusing and may even be red herrings</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>andrew</b>: It has been good to confront my aversion to the article. Bringing up many beliefs especially around intelligence, and feeling intelligent, rather than allowing intelligence to operate. I've got a way to go on that one...</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>adam</b>: <span class="at-ref">@craig</span>: When you said go into the feeling to see what belief is attached, do you mean that by feeling the feeling, we can figure out why we feel that way and the feeling will be associated with a belief or beliefs of which to root out</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>adam</b>: and then by getting rid of the belief, the feeling will disappear?</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: Yes</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: I had considerable success with that approach to a point... i wasnt swanning about in complete freedom from all feelings and I'm not sure any feeling being could accomplish that without living a particular lifestyle such as retirement, but this kind of investigation allows one to thin out many issues that might be preventing access to apperception and thus pure intent</b>

  <b>srid</b>: I had an another good day with less of battles. It came down to watching movies all day in a cafe, and going for dinner alone. Nothing eventful, but I&#8217;m content with how it turned out, although a bit of hope is still in the background. I began by trying to consistently maintain current-time awareness (and then naivete).</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: Funny how without a job (and traditional marriage), life is stripped of &#8216;meaningful activities&#8217; &#8230; to the point I&#8217;m left with entertainment to fill in time. I think I&#8217;ll take up on computer gaming as well. For some reason, I don&#8217;t like to stay at home .. so I go out to cafes and what not.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: But the activities are irrelevant. I&#8217;m keen on navigating the 4 stages (current-time/place awareness; naivete; sensousness; wide-eyed wonder) while doing these easy, fun and so-called &#8216;meaningless&#8217; activities. I think there is no better way to say &#8216;Fuck you&#8217; to society than this.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: Just so that we do not water down what is on offer on the AFT, the second stage is not referred to as naivete..the very last stage of wide-eyed wonder is naivete</b>

</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: From the AFT : <br><br><blockquote> "What ensues when one walks through the world in a state of wide-eyed wonder and amazement (naivet&#233;)..."</blockquote></b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: <blockquote> "Such imitative felicity/ innocuity, in conjunction with sensuosity, readily evokes amazement, marvel, and delight ... <b>a state of wide-eyed wonder best expressed by the word naivet&#233;.</b>"</blockquote></b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: What I mean is that we can simply use another word for 1a/2 so as to not water-down anything on offer on AFT..or worse getting confused ourselves</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: ya that&#8217;s fine. i took 1a/2 to mean allowing the burried-down child-like naivete take over, as in "wow, those tree look cool!&#8221;. AFT doesn&#8217;t seem to have a label for it, as distinct form naivete, although Richard referred to &#8216;becoming naivete&#8217; vs &#8216;being naivete&#8217; to Claudiu once.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: yeah I've personally found that feeling naive is different from becoming naivete</b>

<div>
  <b>srid</b>: also Craig&#8217;s 1a/2 is something I can relate to more than Richard&#8217;s naivete. so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll work with.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: Ha nice, some amazing effort you put there to make this map</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: <span class="at-ref">@actualshashank</span>: my second stage was definitely more about feeling naive than being naivete</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>craig</b>: I only really explored being naivete in the early months of 2016</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: Indeed, I agree <span class="at-ref">@craig</span> ... they are clearly different...full blown naivete, whenever it has happened with me feels like a different way of being</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>srid</b>: What&#8217;s the difference between &#8220;feeling naivete&#8221; and &#8220;being naivete&#8221;?</b>

  <b>ianclarkson</b>: <span class="at-ref">@craig</span>: Hi. I realised my question came from a feeling of worry about not doing this right, as well as a feeling of helplessness and a need to have my hand held. When I was in class today, I noticed that a had a similar fear about how confident I felt in class, and realised that feeling insecure is a way to feel secure by staying within the limits of the group - afraid to let go of the hand-holding support a group has. I was afraid not of being incompetent, but of being confident and no longer belonging. So I went in and out of this. It certainly made it easier to speak up. Also it brought with it another experience of no relationship. When I don't need to belong, I don't have a relationship. It is good to experience that the opposite of belonging is freedom, not isolation. That gives me more confidence.</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>actualshashank</b>: When being naivete(experienced twice), there is a distinct impression that one is in a different way of 'being' altogether...as-if one is going to move to another world</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>ianclarkson</b>: <span class="at-ref">@srid</span>: I like your map at first glance</b>
</div>
<div>
  <b>ianclarkson</b>: Two days ago I was looking around at everyone in my class and wondering about how they were all entities like me. That evening I tapped my partner on her chest and said 'we are the same thing', and it clicked in me. We are all the exact same creature. Over the last couple of days it has been sinking in a bit more. It did some damage to the good person/bad person belief system. We are all in the same boat, so I can't take 'sides', I just want everyone to become free. There are no people more deserving/less deserving. Pretty neat.</b>
